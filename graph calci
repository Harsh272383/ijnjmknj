Creating a comprehensive graphing calculator with all these features in a text-based Python environment is a complex task. However, I can provide you with a basic example that can graph functions and solve quadratic equations using the matplotlib library for graphing and sympy for equation solving. Please note that this example won't cover all the requested features.

First, you'll need to install the required libraries if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib sympy
Now, here's a Python script that demonstrates the basic functionalities you requested:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

def graph_function(expr, x_range=(-10, 10), num_points=400):
    x = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], num_points)
    y = [sp.N(expr.subs('x', xi)) for xi in x]
    plt.plot(x, y, label=f'y = {expr}')

def plot_shaded_area(expr, x_range=(-10, 10), num_points=400, shade_below=True):
    x = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], num_points)
    y = [sp.N(expr.subs('x', xi)) for xi in x]
    plt.plot(x, y, label=f'y = {expr}')
    
    if shade_below:
        plt.fill_between(x, y, alpha=0.2)
    else:
        plt.fill_between(x, y, y[0], alpha=0.2)

def solve_and_graph_quadratic(a, b, c, x_range=(-10, 10), num_points=400):
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    quadratic_expr = a * x**2 + b * x + c
    
    solutions = sp.solve(quadratic_expr, x)
    
    graph_function(quadratic_expr, x_range, num_points)
    
    for solution in solutions:
        plt.scatter(solution, 0, color='red', marker='o', label=f'Root: x = {solution}')

def main():
    while True:
        print("Options:")
        print("1. Graph a function")
        print("2. Shade above/below a line")
        print("3. Solve and graph a quadratic equation")
        print("4. Quit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): ")

        if choice == "1":
            expression = sp.sympify(input("Enter a function in terms of 'x': "))
            graph_function(expression)
        elif choice == "2":
            expression = sp.sympify(input("Enter a function in terms of 'x': "))
            shade_option = input("Shade below the line? (y/n): ").strip().lower() == 'y'
            plot_shaded_area(expression, shade_below=shade_option)
        elif choice == "3":
            a = float(input("Enter the coefficient of x^2: "))
            b = float(input("Enter the coefficient of x: "))
            c = float(input("Enter the constant term: "))
            solve_and_graph_quadratic(a, b, c)
        elif choice == "4":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

        plt.xlabel("x")
        plt.ylabel("y")
        plt.legend()
        plt.grid(True)
        plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This code provides a basic text-based interface for graphing functions and solving quadratic equations. It doesn't include all the requested features, but it's a starting point that you can build upon. For more advanced features like system of equations and zooming, you would need to invest significantly more effort and potentially use a graphical user interface (GUI) library like Tkinter or PyQt.
