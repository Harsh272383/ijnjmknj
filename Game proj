Game 1: Number Guessing Game
In this game, the player needs to guess a randomly generated number.

python
Copy code
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        guess = int(input("Guess the secret number (between 1 and 100): "))
        attempts += 1

        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Try higher!")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Try lower!")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

Game 2: Arithmetic Quiz
This game quizzes the player with arithmetic questions and keeps track of their score.

python
Copy code
import random

def arithmetic_quiz():
    score = 0
    num_questions = 5

    for _ in range(num_questions):
        num1 = random.randint(1, 10)
        num2 = random.randint(1, 10)
        operator = random.choice(['+', '-', '*', '/'])

        expression = f"{num1} {operator} {num2}"
        correct_answer = eval(expression)

        user_answer = float(input(f"What is {expression}? "))

        if user_answer == correct_answer:
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is {correct_answer}")

    print(f"You got {score} out of {num_questions} questions correct!")

Game 3: Math Puzzle Solver
This game generates a math puzzle that the player needs to solve.

python
Copy code
import random

def math_puzzle():
    num1 = random.randint(1, 10)
    num2 = random.randint(1, 10)
    operator = random.choice(['+', '-', '*', '/'])

    expression = f"{num1} {operator} {num2}"
    correct_answer = eval(expression)

    print("Solve the math puzzle:")
    print(expression)

    while True:
        user_answer = float(input("Your answer: "))

        if user_answer == correct_answer:
            print("Correct!")
            break
        else:
            print("Incorrect. Try again.")
